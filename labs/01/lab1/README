This directory contains:

  * An example Makefile that you can modify to use for your gol program.
    It has a lot of comments about how to use it and which definitions
    to change.

  * An example of separating functionality of a program into separate
    .c files (modules) and creating and using a .h file shared by 
    multiple modules.

    * examples of how to use extern and static modifiers in definitions
      and what that means are described in comments
      
You can use these files as a guide for creating your gol program.
If you actually modify the contents of these files for your gol, make
sure to remove all my comments about C definitions and scope and add
comments that describe your gol program.


C_examples.c: this contains some examples of where C differs from C++
              there is a lot more documentation about C and C libraries
              off my help pages

        compile with gcc and run resulting a.out

        gcc -g C_examples.c
        ./a.out
